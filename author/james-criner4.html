          <div class=summary><p> <p>Things are moving along at our local club. Everyone knows how to handle the signup process. Three (3) late shooters were added to squads on the bays after the mobile devices were deployed. It's not as quick as squadding from the signup list, but it works just fine.</p>

          <div class=summary><p> <p>Today we ran our first group of classifiers at the local club and things went very well. You can sign up classifiers on the mobile device at the bay pretty quickly. Once you save the proper number stages with the proper number of string times for each stage, the SO ...</p></p></div>

          <div class=summary><p> <p>Following some feature additions, we again followed one (1) squad for six (6) stages and confirmed the paper results. Things are working very well, and results reports are ready shortly after the match is complete.</p>

          <div class=summary><p> <p>For the near term, we've opted to deploy the server software as a guest appliance that can be imported in to <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris hosts. So deployment consists of the following steps:</p>

          <div class=summary><p> <p>Improvements were made to the score confirmation dialog, and the "Shooter Agree?" checkbox was moved from the score page to the score confirmation dialog.  This is much more consistent with how people were actually reading out scores in the field.</p>

          <div class=summary><p> <p>During last month's debrief, we realized that there was a dilemma running both paper and the electronic scoring system. While it was a good thing that we had a backup to check results, it turned out that most of the errors occured because the person running the tablet did ...</p></p></div>

          <div class=summary><p> <p>Several of the abbreviations used were corrected to match the official abbreviations from the <a href="http://idpa.com/">IDPA &trade;</a> rulebook. An additional check was added to ensure that shooters are registered as re-runs during the signup process if they had previously shot the match.</p></p></div>

We used the scoring system for one (1) squad on six (6) stages and confirmed that the results matched the results from paper.

          <div class=summary><p> <p>After a considerable amount of testing, we held our first <a href="http://idpa.com/">IDPA &trade;</a> match of the year.

Below is a list of changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;[0.5.1] - 2017-02-11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Added&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added "down_value" to server config (defaults to 1.0 2017 rules). Score is calculated as PD * down_value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added option to get results as a webpage or PDF download.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added "best of" feature to season standings to allow throwouts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added "XXX" = "Anything Goes" division as a catchall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added import and editor for arbitrary unofficial divisions (think SPD, PCC, BBQ, ETC).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added BUG-R, BUG-S to make_model.csv to allow for subdivisions via makes.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the make/model/caliber feature at signup to identify subdivisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results are still grouped by division, but you can use this method to identify subdivisions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added First Responder (FP) category. We have been using it for years locally and figured others may want to as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Changed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed scoring formula for Points Down from PD * 0.5 to PD * 1.0 (2017 Rules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed scoring formula and scoring program to add Flagrant Penalty FP * 10.0 (2017 Rules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed scoring formula and scoring program to remove Failure To Neutralize FTN * 5.0 (2017 Rules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed number of strings and rounds for classifier from 7, 4, 3 (90) to 3, 3, 2 (72) (2017 Rules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed classification times for new classifier (2017 Rules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Removed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove timezone specification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed Not For Competition (NFC) Division.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed FTN button from scoring app (2017 Rules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a number of breaking changes in this version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can still generate reports from existing matches and classifiers, but any attempt to change (admin/stage edit) and / or re-upload (scoring/upload) existing scores will lead to problems. If you need to do that, you should be using the versions that generated the scores in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Category differences from 2017 Rulebook:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M6 Competitors may choose ONE of the following to add to their registration...&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This change is probably to prevent a single shooter from being acknowledged in multiple categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The software currently associates "categories" with shooters, not with entries, because categories do not tend to change match to match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you believe that someone who served their fellow citizens (Military, Law Enforcement, First Responder) and their fellow shooters (Safety Officer) deserves to be recognized as both, continue to check as many categories as are appropriate for each shooter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WORKAROUND: If you want to strictly comply with the 2017 rules, simply make sure that each shooter has only one category checked at any given time. The score reports will reflect the category checked at the time the report is generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M6.8 Military &amp;amp; M6.9 Law Enforcement are now "active" only. This change is probably to force consistency with the one category change above.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We strongly believe that anyone who took an oath to serve their fellow citizens deserves to be recognized no matter how long they were able to serve. As such, our default category descriptions for Military, Law Enforcement, and First Responder will always reflect that. If a Veteran can outshoot an Active Member, then we would like to recognize them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WORKAROUND: If you want to strictly comply with the 2017 rules and have your category descriptions consistent with the rulebook there are two options:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit your categories.csv file before you start the program for the first time and create your database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact us and we will give you simple and straightforward instructions on how to edit the category descriptions in your existing database. It isn't hard and we are happy to help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get it while it's hot! We've been using this software for two (4) years at our local club. It works, it is reliable, and it is up to date. We score matches as fast or faster than on paper with fewer errors. And, it has saved us countless hours scoring matches and distributing results.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ssmi"></category><category term="release"></category><category term="features"></category></entry><entry><title>IDPA 2016</title><link href="http://shootingsportsmobile.com/blog/2016/10/09/idpa_20161009/index.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-10-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>James Criner</name></author><id>tag:shootingsportsmobile.com,2016-10-09:blog/2016/10/09/idpa_20161009/index.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another season is complete at our local club.

&lt;p&gt;Half of our SO's took one (1) thirty (30) minute training class. Everyone else learned on the fly during a match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoring was straight forward as the scoring program allows you to have shooters from different matches on the same squad. Results were done for all three matches and season standings within the hour. Then it was on to the awards and banquet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to everyone for another great season and all your support!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ssmi"></category><category term="match"></category></entry><entry><title>SSMI v0.3.0 Released</title><link href="http://shootingsportsmobile.com/blog/2014/09/19/new_version/index.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-09-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>James Criner</name></author><id>tag:shootingsportsmobile.com,2014-09-19:blog/2014/09/19/new_version/index.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've released v0.3.0 of both the server program and the scoring application for &lt;a href="http://idpa.com/"&gt;IDPA &amp;trade;&lt;/a&gt;. Below is a short list of changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified install process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New install help file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New bundled executable files for Windows, Mac, and Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New flexible licensing options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New server messages on startup related to licensing and ip addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Terms and Conditions including open source software notices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New SQL command interface to interact with the database directly.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;New check for valid IDPA numbers on signup and when shooting a classifier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get it while it's hot! We've been using this software for two (2) years at our local club. It works. It is reliable. We score matches as fast or faster than on paper with fewer errors.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are now installable apps for iOS and Android suitable for the App Store and Google Play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new theme which features:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Largely black and white colors for better outdoor visibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bigger fonts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flat and more responsive buttons and dropdowns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You now edit the squad order by dragging left to move up, and right to move down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Times and downs inputs automatically translate any disallowed character into a comma allowing the use of number or telephone style keypads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are tighter controls on the score page which prevent you from leaving the page, changing stages, or changing shooters unless the current data on the page is already saved or blank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Upload and Delete Data pages now itemize the data to be uploaded or deleted so SO's can better review the information before taking action.&lt;/li&gt;

No issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made use of categories during the signup process and for the match report. Things worked well and it didn't slow down the signup process one bit. However, there were two (2) recurring comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"First Responders" might be more inclusive than just "Law Enforcement".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The language in the 2013 rules (1.2.4.8), "active or retired military" led to almost all of our military veterans saying they didn't qualify because they were neither "active" or "retired" in the sense that they had put in 20 years. Whatever the original intent, we felt any military veteran had more than earned their recognition in the category and went with "active military or veteran". It just seemed like the right thing to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was the last match of the 2013 outdoor season, we needed to finalize season standings for awards before the banquet after the match. That's were the scoring system really paid off. Match results, season standings, and award plaques were all done before the props were put away in the barn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great season and many thanks go out to all of our shooters and safety officers for making the new scoring system work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads"&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

While it was a good thing that we had a backup to check results, it turned out that most of the errors occured because the person running the tablet did not feel solely responsible for scoring the stage and may not have double checked their entries. This month everyone got thrown in to the deep end and we ditched the paper.  All shooters were offered paper scoresheets to keep for themselves, and everyone declined!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it wasn't safest move from a technical point of view, it all worked out and had several positive outcomes. First, the timer SO and the scorekeeper SO developed better communication without the third person being involved. Second, the scorekeeper SO became more responsible and stopped scoring to correct typos before moving on. Third, shooters became much more interested in confirming their scores on the stage knowing there wasn't a paper backup and that they had declined to keep their own score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signup went smoothly, eight (8) squads completed eight (8) stages, and results were emailed out within 30 minutes after the last shot was fired.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ssmi"></category><category term="match"></category></entry><entry><title>Bug Fixes and Feature Additions</title><link href="http://shootingsportsmobile.com/blog/2013/04/12/signup_check_and_abbr/index.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>James Criner</name></author><id>tag:shootingsportsmobile.com,2013-04-12:blog/2013/04/12/signup_check_and_abbr/index.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Several of the abbreviations used were corrected to match the official abbreviations from the &lt;a href="http://idpa.com/"&gt;IDPA &amp;trade;&lt;/a&gt; rulebook.

Electronic scoring from the tablets was backed up on paper and there were only a few inconsistencies that needed to be fixed. Scores were corrected and completed within an hour after the match was over. Results were emailed out before we left the club.
